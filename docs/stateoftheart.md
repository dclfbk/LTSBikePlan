Title: **Low-Stress Bicycling and Network Connectivity**

Authors: Maaza C. Mekuria, Peter G. Furth, Hilary Nixon (Mineta Transportation Institute - 2012)

Description: This research report examines the concept of low-stress bicycling network connectivity, emphasizing the importance of creating connected networks for cyclists to improve safety, accessibility, and ridership. The authors argue that the degree of connectivity of low-stress bicycle networks has a significant impact on the number of people who choose to ride bicycles for transportation.

Key Findings: 



1. Low-stress streets, which are comfortable for most riders, can be classified into four categories: L1 (lowest stress), L2, L3, and L4 (highest stress). The study focuses on creating connected networks of L1 and L2 streets. 
2. The study reveals that the majority of current bicycle networks in the United States consist of disconnected segments and high-stress links, which discourages many people from cycling. 
3. The authors propose a method to assess network connectivity based on five dimensions: directness, coherence, route complexity, safety, and comfort. 
4. The study demonstrates that improving low-stress network connectivity can lead to a considerable increase in the number of people who choose to bicycle for transportation.
5. It also highlights the importance of addressing gaps and barriers in the existing bicycle network to ensure continuous and low-stress routes for cyclists. 
6. Recommendations for improving low-stress network connectivity include investing in infrastructure, prioritizing low-stress routes, integrating with public transit, and considering the needs of all potential users.
* Interesting aspects emerged:
1. Islands of connectivity: sets of links connected to one another but not connected to the rest of the network. The study found that low-stress links or "connectivity clusters" are of limited use for bicycle transportation if they lack low-stress interconnecting links. The study identified three types of barriers that separate low-stress clusters from one another: natural and manmade barriers created by freeways, railroads, and creeks that require grade-separated crossings; arterial streets; and breaks in the residential street grid. The study highlights the importance of low-stress, grade-separated crossings of barriers in enhancing connectivity. 
2. TAZ and Census blocks: Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs) vary in size according to population density and are usually treated as if demand is concentrated at their centroid. However, the critical issue with zone size for bicycling is not differences in distance or travel time but differences in connectivity. TAZs with incomplete street grids or barriers may only have some points accessible to the bicycling network via low-stress links. The study suggests that land parcels (individual buildings) may be a better unit of demand for analyzing transit service, while TAZs are more appropriate for analyzing travel by automobile. The study proposes using Census blocks as the geographical unit of demand for analyzing bicycle connectivity. Census blocks typically match the common understanding of a city block and have several vertices on their perimeter, which are assumed to be connected to the network if any vertex in or around a block is connected to the network. In shortest-path analysis with blocks as units of demand, each block is represented by a centroid, with connectors between it and the vertices on the perimeter of the block. This compromise between using land parcels and TAZs allows for more accurate bicycle connectivity analysis at a citywide or regional level.
3. Regarding Network Connectivity: a new measure of connectivity has been proposed for evaluating the effectiveness of a bicycling network. The measure is expressed as a percentage of trips that are connected without exceeding a given level of traffic stress and without undue detour. The measure can be calculated using a trip table and a network analysis with block centroids or by looking only at the connectivity between vertex pairs or node pairs in the street and path network. The paper suggests limiting the measure of connectivity to trips in a distance range appropriate to bicycling, such as 4, 6, or 8 miles, to emphasize the bike network's potential to shift trips of moderate length to bicycling. The definition maintains fairness in comparisons between different levels of traffic stress.

Best ideas identified: 

Here a summary of the useful metrics used to assess the overall connectivity of a bicycle network and how were obtained:



1. Directness:
    * Measure the shortest path between origin and destination using the existing network.
    * Calculate the ratio of the shortest path distance on the bicycle network to the direct distance (as-the-crow-flies) between the origin and destination. A ratio closer to 1 indicates better directness.
2. Coherence
    * Assess the continuity of bicycle facilities (e.g., dedicated lanes, shared lanes) throughout the network.
    * Identify the number of gaps or missing links in the network.
    * Determine the frequency of route changes and transitions between different types of bicycle facilities.
    * Calculate the connectivity index, which can be the ratio of the number of available routes to the total possible routes between various origin-destination pairs.
3. Route complexity
    * Count the number of turns and intersections a cyclist must navigate along a given route.
    * Analyze the presence of decision points and complexity of junctions.
    * Develop a complexity score based on the combination of these factors, with lower scores indicating simpler routes.
4. Safety
    * Evaluate the presence and quality of dedicated bike lanes, traffic calming measures, and intersection designs (e.g., bike boxes, protected intersections).
    * Analyze traffic volume and speed data to assess the level of exposure to motorized traffic.
    * Calculate crash rates or collision risk for cyclists using available accident data.
    * Develop a safety score based on these factors, with higher scores indicating safer routes.
5. Comfort
    * Assess pavement quality and surface conditions along the routes.
    * Evaluate the width of bike lanes and the degree of separation from motorized traffic (e.g., physical barriers, buffer zones).
    * Consider factors such as noise, air pollution, and the presence of shade or greenery along routes.

Main data sources: data on each street segment including its geographical coordinates, curb-to-curb width, number of lanes, width of median, speed limit, and functional class (residential, arterial, freeway): database indicating which intersections have traffic signals; map of bike and pedestrian facilities that includes standalone trails and small links for non-motorized traffic – such as footbridges over freeways – and shows the location of bike lanes and data on bike-lane width obtained from field measurements on streets with bike lanes.

Title: **Prioritizing new bicycle facilities to improve low-stress network connectivity**

Authors: Michael B. Lowry, Peter Furth, Tracy Hadden-Loh (2016)

Description: This paper presents a new approach to prioritize bicycle improvement projects based on the accessibility of key destinations (e.g restaurants, grocery stores ec.). The method utilizes a novel approach to classify "bicycling stress" by using marginal rates of substitution derived from empirical behavioral research on cyclist route selection. MRS values, which factor in the number of lanes and speed limit of a street, serve as input parameters. The approach was programmed as a geographic information system tool and uses commonly available data. The tool was then applied to three improvement scenarios proposed for Seattle with various bike lanes, protected bike lanes, and multi-use trails. The tool generates priority rankings based on a project's capacity to enhance low-stress connectivity between homes and vital destinations. The analysis pinpoints specific neighborhoods and areas that are expected to have greater bikeability.

Best idea identified:

* Stress determination through MRS: MRS, which stands for Marginal Rate of Substitution, is an economic concept that measures the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another. In cycling research MRS has been determined with the use of GPS trackers and logistic regression analysis for different road conditions. MRS values are commonly used by practitioners and researchers in route choice modeling within a regional travel demand model. In this work traffic stress has been measured in terms of MRS using two values, a stress-generating factor reflecting traffic attributes, and a stress-reducing factor representing bike accommodation. They established 11 types of roadways primarily based on the number of lanes and speed limit, as identified by Mekuria et al. (2012). Stress-reducing factors are established for five bike accommodation levels: signed bike routes with no further accommodation (5% reduction), sharrows (10%), conventional bike lanes (50%), buffered bike lanes (65%), and protected bike lanes (75%). MRS factors can be grouped into Level of Traffic Stress categories using thresholds for stress factors that correspond to the framework of Mekuria et al. (2012) as can be seen in the below table.More math details inside the methodology section of the paper (pag. 4-7).

Title: ** TS Bikeability Assessment tool**

Authors:  Planning for Complete Communities in Delaware (2016)

Description: The Low-Stress Bikeability Assessment Tool, which aims to aid local governments in Delaware in enhancing the low-stress bikeability within their communities, offers a resourceful guide for the evaluation of accessible low-stress areas for average bicycle riders and the development of strategic plans that effectively utilize state investments to enhance local cycling networks and bicycle infrastructure. LTS  analysis has been conducted, based on Peter Furth work, on roadways, streets, and pathways throughout the state and a series of maps has been created. The Low-Stress Bicycling Assessment is composed of a three-step process, which is intended to engage diverse community representatives in evaluating low-stress bicycling options. The first step involves preparing for the assessment by engaging community members, reviewing plans and resources, gathering data, and selecting a study area. The second one provides a checklist ([https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/a/390/files/2016/02/LSBA_Checklist-11nwqkf.pdf](https://bpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/a/390/files/2016/02/LSBA_Checklist-11nwqkf.pdf)) to gather participants’ opinions on bikeability conditions. In the specific the following topics are investigated (facilities, network, road conditions, visibility, intersection, transit interaction)  Lastly, the third one involves prioritizing concerns, creating a written summary, presenting findings to key stakeholders and funding entities, and developing an action plan.

Title: **Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress Map**

Authors: City of Boston Transportation Department, Tool Design Group (2020)

Description: The article introduces the Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) Map, a tool which visualizes the stress levels experienced by cyclists on various streets and intersections throughout the city. The map uses the LTS methodology to assign scores ranging from 1 (low stress) to 4 (high stress) based on factors such as speed limits, road widths, and separation from motorized traffic. The goal of the map is to help identify areas where improvements can be made to create a safer and more comfortable cycling environment, ultimately encouraging more people to choose cycling as a mode of transportation. Specifically, the LTS methodology is an adaptation of Mineta's work that classifies roadways and intersections into four levels based on several factors, including traffic volume, speed, road width, and the presence of bicycle facilities. These levels are: LTS 1 (Low Stress): suitable for children and the majority of people. Roadways here are characterized by protected bike lanes. LTS 2 (Moderate Stress): suitable for adult cyclists with some experience, the lanes present some turning. LTS 3 (High Stress): suitable for experienced and confident adult cyclists. Roadways may have bike lanes next to multilane vehicular traffic with above average traffic volumes or vehicular speeds higher than Boston’s default speed limit. Finally, LTS 4 (Very High Stress): only suitable for strong and fearless cyclists who can tolerate significant traffic stress.

Best ideas identified: 

Here the criteria used for assessing LTS scores, conflict factors are included, namely the ones that make riding more difficult, such as industrial, commercial, or hotel land uses; key bus routes; pick-up/drop-off zones, (including cab stands and valet zones); or proximity to schools. 


![LTS Criteria table](images/07.png)


The four primary attributes included, such as vehicle volumes, speed limits, bicycle facilities, and parking are chosen because of their direct impacts on the level of traffic stress people riding bikes experience. Vehicle volumes are categorized into four groups: Fewer than 1,500 vehicles per day , between 1,500 and 2,999 vehicles per day, between 3,000 and 5,999 vehicles per day and over 6,000 vehicles per day. Where data are unavailable for volumes, street segments are grouped into one of the four-volume categories: under 1,500 vehicles per day: streets in the neighborhood slow zone designation, between 1,500 and 2,999 vehicles per day: all other local streets. These streets are used primarily for access to adjacent properties and minimally for cut-through traffic, between 3,000 and 5,999 vehicles per day: collector streets and 1-lane minor arterial streets. These streets are used for both local access and cut-through traffic, over 6,000 vehicles per day: any principal arterial and minor arterials with two or more lanes per direction. These streets are primarily used to travel between areas and carry the highest traffic volumes. Regarding speed limits, it is well known that higher speeds increase the risk of injury in the event of a crash with a person riding a bicycle and makes biking feel more stressful. The city of Boston has a speed limit of 25 mph. This is the default value for all streets unless otherwise posted. To confirm posted speed limits greater than 25mph, the analysis team used Google Street View on targeted street categories. Bicycle facilities on the other hand offer dedicated space or priority for bicyclists and therefore they can decrease the LTS score for a street.

Title: **Berlin wants streets like this**

Authors: Martin Baske et al. (TagesSpiegel) (2020)

Description: Berlin Street Check survey on street safety and possible future design on bicycle paths. The participants,  cyclist or drivers, were asked to assess a range of street scenes that were generated automatically. These scenes were viewed from either the perspective of a bike, car, or pedestrian and featured a combination of numerous road characteristics. For instance, a wide bike lane, heavy car traffic, a white dividing line with no bollard, a curb on the right, and no parked cars on the roadside. This led to a plethora of potential combinations. There were four options for every picture: Do you feel “safe”, “rather safe”, “rather unsafe” or “unsafe” in this situation? When comparing the simulations of primary roads, it became evident that one of the most critical factors is the separation between car and bicycle traffic. Other elements, such as parked cars, speed limits, and the color of the bike path were considered. Among these factors, cycle paths that are separated from motorized traffic by concrete flower boxes had the best performance. However, it turned out that the exact form of protection did not matter as long as it prevented cars from running over cyclists. Structural separations also prevented vehicles from overtaking too closely or parking next to the lines (the open door negative effect), green color for the bike paths were judged more useful than the ones with no color.

Best idea identified: the presence of specific characteristics of bike lanes (presence of dividers, plants, specific width, color) that can be taken into account to adjust stress levels and the possibility of adjusting stress levels based on objective data with behavioral data on perceptions of safety.

Title: **Level of Traffic Stress Methodology**

Authors: Montgomery County Planning Department (2021)

Description: This paper presents a modified version of the Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) methodology for evaluating bicycle infrastructure and its impact on cyclist safety and comfort. The authors discuss the limitations of the original LTS methodology and propose enhancements that provide a more accurate representation of the stress experienced by cyclists on different roadways. The modified LTS methodology considers various factors such as roadway width, speed limits, intersection design, and separation from motorized traffic, which were not fully addressed in the original method. By incorporating these additional factors, the modified LTS methodology allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to cyclist stress. 

URL/DOI: [https://mcatlas.org/bikestress/documentation/ModifiedLevelOfTrafficStressMethodology.pdf](https://mcatlas.org/bikestress/documentation/ModifiedLevelOfTrafficStressMethodology.pdf)

Best ideas identified: the account of various factors such as roadway width, speed limits, intersection design, and separation from motorized traffic. This modified approach enables a better understanding of the stress levels experienced by cyclists.



1. Table-Link Methodology for Mixed Traffic / Priority Shared Lane Markings: this table outlines the evaluation of mixed traffic and priority shared lane markings based on four factors: speed limit, presence of parking, number of travel lanes, and lane width. It assigns LTS scores (1-4) for various combinations of these factors, with 1 being the lowest stress level and 4 being the highest. 
2. Table-Link Methodology for Conventional Bike Lanes: this table evaluates conventional bike lanes using five factors: speed limit, presence of parking, number of travel lanes, bike lane width, and buffer width. It assigns LTS scores based on these factors, again ranging from 1 to 4. This table highlights that a well-designed bike lane can reduce stress for cyclists, but certain factors such as high-speed traffic or narrow bike lanes can still contribute to higher stress levels.
3. Table-Link Methodology for Shared Use Paths: the table for shared use paths considers three factors: speed limit, crossing frequency, and separation from the roadway. LTS scores are assigned based on these factors, with higher scores assigned to paths with less separation from high-speed traffic or more frequent crossings. This table emphasizes the importance of separation and crossing frequency in creating low-stress shared-use paths.
4. Table-Link Methodology for Separated Bike Lanes: this table evaluates separated bike lanes based on five factors: speed limit, presence of parking, number of travel lanes, bike lane width, and buffer width/separation type. LTS scores are assigned according to these factors, illustrating that the stress level of a separated bike lane depends on the design and the road context. Well-designed separated bike lanes with sufficient buffer widths or physical barriers can result in lower stress levels for cyclists. 
5. Table-Link Methodology for Bikeable Shoulders, Neighborhood Greenways, Shared Streets: The evaluation of bikeable shoulders, neighborhood greenways, and shared streets is based on three factors: speed limit, number of travel lanes, and shoulder/greenway width. LTS scores are assigned according to these factors, showing that lower speed limits and wider shoulders or greenways can result in lower stress levels for cyclists. This table highlights the importance of road design in providing low-stress environments for cyclists on various types of streets.

Title: **DVRPC** **Bicycle LST & Connectivity Analysis**

Authors: Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (2021)

Description: This regional screening tool was developed to help identify and rank roads where bicycle facility improvements would have the greatest local and regional connectivity benefit to the low-stress bicycle network. The analysis aims to identify road segments that can be redesigned to improve low-stress bike connectivity alongside resurfacing work. The goal is to identify projects that can have a meaningful impact on low-stress bike connectivity. For example, adding bike lanes to a short stretch of roadway can have a significant local impact if it helps connect low-stress residential streets and contributes to building a low-stress regional network over time. The analysis will prioritize road segments that can provide these connections and contribute to building a low-stress network. The analysis involved an LST score assignment, followed by the addition of the slope as another factor in the connectivity analysis with specific focus on schools’  connection to find the shortest and less stressful paths.

Best ideas identified:



* LTS score assignment: the analysis relied on MRS stress values from Lowry et al. with the exception that all two-lane roads classified as residential/local with speeds above 30mph were assigned values from line 2 of Table 2. Values were assigned based on the number of lanes, effective modeled speed, and the presence and type of a bicycle facility, using the following upper limits: LTS 1 (10%), LTS 2 (30%), LTS 3 (60%), and LTS 4 (no limit). In phase one, off-road trails were grouped with LTS 1 road segments, but in phase two, trails were considered separately with an LTS of 0. The analysis used a modified turn LTS assignment method, based on the "weakest link" logic presented in the Mineta report, since traffic signal and functional priority data was not consistently available at the regional scale. In the specific, each turn direction was treated differently: right turns were assigned the LTS of the road segment to which the turn was being made, left turns were assigned the LTS of the road segment to which the turn was being made, multiplied by two (in fact left turns are typically more stressful, than right turns), straight movements were assigned the maximum LTS value of all the links at the intersection (by doing this, the impact of crossing a high-stress street was accounted for, finally U-turns were excluded from the analysis (Straight Cost = 0.005 × (1 + Turn LTS); Right Turn Cost = 0.005 × (1 + 1 + Turn LTS); Left Turn Cost = 0.005 × (1 + 2 + Turn LTS)).
* Regarding slopes’ scores, the assignment to each road segment has been done using the commute factors presented in this work  “Slope in Terms of MRS” by Briach, Dill, Gliebe. 

![Slope factors](images/08.png)


* These factors were included in the "overall cost" calculation for each road segment, which also takes into account the length and assigned LTS (Cost = Link Length × (1 + Link LTS + Link Slope Factor)). The method of incorporating slope did not affect LTS assignment or the coloring of road segments in the "existing conditions" layer. 
* “Geoff link”: analysis combined turns and links to create a complete routable network by exploding every node in the network into repeated nodes at the same location, referred to as "geoffs". Nodes were numbered starting with 100, and links were identified using a "from-node" and a "to-node". This made it possible to identify each component by a from-geoff and a to-geoff.

Title: **BikeDNA: A Tool for Bicycle Infrastructure Data & Network Assessment**

Authors: Ane Rahbek Vierø, Anastassia Vybornova, Michael Szell  (2022)

Description: Existing tools for road network data quality assessment do not account for network topology, spatial heterogeneity, and bicycle-specific data characteristics. In order to address these issues, a computational tool named BikeDNA (Bicycle Infrastructure Data & Network Assessment) was developed. It can be defined as an open-source tool very helpful for reproducible quality assessment tailored to bicycle infrastructure data. It allows standalone analysis of one dataset , extrinsic (comparative) analysis between OpenStreetMap and a reference dataset etc. Specifically, the tool possesses a structured and straightforward quality evaluation mechanism for bicycle infrastructure data, which can be utilized for several applications such as bicycle routing, connectivity analysis, network quality assessment, and accessibility studies. BikeDNA can help improve the quality of a data set by pinpointing both which features and which locations gaps, errors, or inconsistencies exist.  BikeDNA integrates and illustrates an extensive array of spatial quality metrics related to Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Interactive maps and HTML/PDF reports can be generated to facilitate the visual exploration and communication of results.

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01223.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01223.pdf)

Best idea identified: BikeDNA turns out to be a useful tool for filling data gaps (omission, commission) or improving the quality of data in reference datasets (topology errors, misclassification). It can be considered a redefinition tool. BikeDNA conducts analysis in both global and local scale, network density analysis  (e.g by comparing different networks completeness using simplified versions of the networks), consistency of OSM tags (width, speed limits, street lights, or other characteristics of interest to cyclists) which poses limits to assessing bikeability (and LTS), network topology (e.g. analysis of undershoots or dangling nodes), the presence of disconnected components (also relevant for LTS evaluation), feature matching to compensate missing values. However, as highlighted by the authors, BikeDNA emphasizes the relevance of local knowledge and familiarity with the area for any kind of planning or research process. Moreover, for simplicity, networks here are undirected, limiting the possibility to check travel direction or turn restrictions.

Title: **Growing urban bicycle networks**

Authors: Michael Szell et al. (2022)

Description: This study aimed to systematically examine the limitations of developing urban bicycle networks in a topological sense. Specifically, the goal was to find fundamental topological limitations of bicycle network development that are relevant for all urban environments, independent of the availability of traffic data. Moreover, the focus was on how to transform an urban network, more suitable for cars, into one more suitable for bikes and pedestrians. The analysis process involved four steps: the first step consists of snapping an arbitrary set of seed points to the street network's intersections. These seed points could represent points of interest such as shopping areas, schools, etc. In the second step, all pairs of seed nodes were connected stepwise in a route distance order, without crossing any existing links, to create an approximately shortest and locally dense planar network. This approach provides a connected, cohesive, and resilient network solution that minimizes investment, satisfying both traveler and investor demands. The third step involves ordering the greedy triangulation links according to three growth strategies (betweenness, closeness, random), resulting in a sequence of growth stages. Finally the last step involves routing the abstract links created in the 40 growth stages on the street network. These synthetic bicycle networks are then analyzed for all 62 cities involved in the work. Then, several metrics were analyzed such as length L, length LLCC of the largest connected component, coverage, seed point coverage, directness, number of connected components and global/local efficiency. Finally comparisons were made with realistic networks. The primary focus was on directness, which is a critical metric for bicycle network planning, apart from connectivity. Directness is the best predictor of quantifiable policy aspects that affect cycling adoption and is the key metric for measuring network quality.

The findings suggest that initial investments in developing cycling-friendly infrastructure lead to diminishing returns in quality and efficiency until a well-connected giant component emerges. Once this threshold is surpassed, the quality improves significantly, depending on the specific growth strategy employed. In other words: the majority of cities fall below this threshold, potentially hindering further growth. Moreover, the majority of bike infrastructures present connect only to already developed areas, not contributing to reducing social-inequalities.

Best idea identified: As suggested by the authors, this “artificial networks” created with specific metrics, can be useful in global scenarios where it is difficult to have all data available or where there are too many differences depending on the different areas analyzed and a comprehensive approach is necessary to make comparisons. For local scenarios instead, it could be used as an initial starting point to show the first connectivity’ gaps.

Title: **Automated Detection of Missing Links in Bicycle Networks**

Authors: Anastassia Vybornova, Tiago  Cunha, Astrid Gühnemann, and Michael Szell

Description: a new methodology called IPDC (Identify, Prioritize, Decluster, Classify) has been created to pinpoint critical missing connections in urban bike networks using OpenStreetMap data. Specifically, the process identifies all potential gaps using a multiplex network method with two different link types (the one for motor drivers (unprotected) and one for bikers (protected)) and three different node types (protected, unprotected, both), ranking them based on a flow-oriented metric, breaking down emerging gap clusters, and individually categorizing gap types. The study demonstrates that network analysis with minimal data input can function as an affordable aid for bike network planning.

[https://github.com/anastassiavybornova/bikenwgaps](https://github.com/anastassiavybornova/bikenwgaps)

Best idea identified: useful procedure for the easy detection of missing and prioritized gaps inside the network using minimal data requirements. It could be useful in cases where there is an urgency to find the highest priority gaps without necessarily having a hyper detailed view of the entire area of interest. However, the gap classification step was made specific for the Copenhagen area (the one analyzed) so it might be adapted. Regarding the gap classes: Street (ST), which are defined as all mixed-traffic street  segments  whose  both  ends  connect  to  protected  bicycle  infrastructure  and  that do not correspond to any of the other gap classes; intersection (IS), which are missing  links  without  protected  bicycle  infrastructure  found  at  crossings  of  two  or  more  streets; right- turn lane (RT); bridge (BR), which are missing links on obstacle- crossing road segments; roundabout (RA); and error (ER), the one not identified correctly.
