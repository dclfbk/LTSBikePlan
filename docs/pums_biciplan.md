**Regarding the PUMS**:
According to the promoters, improving the urban mobility system is an essential goal both to contribute to the fight against climate change and to counteract local scale air pollution phenomena.
Achieving the ambitious goals set by the European Union for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and improving air quality in urban centers can only be achieved with a drastic change of direction in the mobility habits of people and goods. This requires a proper realignment of planning to environmental goals, promoting innovative sustainable mobility projects.
Italy is one of the European countries with the highest motorization rate. 
This, along with the excessive use of private cars for the vast majority of travel, generates a long series of negative externalities - economic, environmental, social, and health-related.
European strategies on urban mobility indicate the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PUMS) as an essential tool to stimulate and govern the necessary change. The use of PUMS is considered a competitive factor in accessing European funding, which is the main resource currently available for Local Authorities.
After the success of the European project ENDURANCE - a pan-European program promoted by 25 countries across Europe that assists Cities and Regions in the development of PUMS by facilitating networking, mutual learning, and sharing of good practices among countries - it has been possible to give life to ENDURANCE Italy - PUMS Observatory. This allows cities already adhering to continue to benefit from the services already available and those that will be activated in the coming months.
The Observatory is a tool primarily intended for cities, thought and designed for them.

Operating in the logic of PUMS means:

- Strongly integrating mobility planning within urban planning and design with a focus on environmental, social, and economic sustainability;

- Adopting an organizational model of urban space giving *PRIORITY TO PEOPLE* rather than vehicles, putting pedestrian and cycling mobility first and the mobility of people before that of vehicles;

- *Enhancing the participatory aspect* in the context of urban mobility planning, promoting the involvement of various stakeholders, creating specific places and occasions for discussion such as Technical Tables, Working Groups, Forums, etc.;

- *Spreading the culture of sustainable, soft*, new mobility in all its forms, through educational, awareness-raising, and information activities, aimed at the population of all ages;

- *Enhancing the role of technology in line with the approach of smart cities* and promoting its use and dissemination in an appropriate manner, i.e. as a tool to achieve certain objectives and not as an objective in itself;

Specifically, A PUMS can be intended as a strategic plan based on existing planning tools, taking into account the principles of integration, participation, and evaluation to meet the current and future mobility needs of people and goods, aiming to improve the quality of life in cities and their surroundings. The policies and measures defined in a PUMS must cover all modes and forms of transport across the entire urban area, including public and private, passenger and freight, motorized and non-motorized, and traffic and parking.
It is not intended as an additional plan. It is crucial to note that a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan builds on existing plans by extending their content.

In summary again, the main purpose of a PUMS is to create an urban transport system that pursues at least the following objectives:

- Improve accessibility for all, without distinctions of income or social status.
- Enhance the quality of life and attractiveness of the urban environment.
- Improve road safety and public health.
- Reduce air and noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy consumption.
- Economic feasibility, social equity, and environmental quality.

The European guidelines also list the main benefits that a PUMS generates, both for local authorities and the community as a whole:

- Improve the quality of life.
- Create economic benefits and reduce costs.
- Make a valid contribution to the improvement of health and the environment.
- Improve accessibility and the fluidity of mobility.
- Make more efficient use of limited resources available.
- Win the consensus of citizens.
- Achieve better plans thanks to an interdisciplinary and integrated approach.
- Manage to fulfill legal obligations effectively and integratively.
- Exploit the synergies of multiple institutions and sectors for collaborative planning.
- Move towards a new culture of mobility.

In the Italian national context, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport published a decree in August 2017 identifying the guidelines for sustainable urban mobility plans, which were updated in August 2019. **The decree makes the adoption of the PUMS mandatory for cities with over 100,000 inhabitants, with exceptions for those in a metropolitan city that has defined its own PUMS.**

Complete guidelines for developing and implementing a sustainable urban mobility plan: [https://www.eltis.org/sites/default/files/sump_guidelines_2019_interactive_document_1.pdf](https://www.eltis.org/sites/default/files/sump_guidelines_2019_interactive_document_1.pdf)

Regarding the bycicle project inside the PUMS, we can introduce the concept of Biciplan which is a strategic plan promoting urban cycling in Italy and identifying key cycling routes in urban areas. Article 6 of the Law 11 January 2018 requires metropolitan cities and non-metropolitan municipalities to adopt the Biciplan as part of their Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (PUMS), governed by D.M. 397/2017 and amended by D.M. 396/2019. According to D.M. 397/2017, the formulation of the Biciplan is mandatory for metropolitan cities and municipalities or associations of municipalities with a population exceeding 100,000. For municipalities with a population less than 100,000, they can draft this plan, but it is not compulsory. 

The Biciplan's objectives are:

- rebalancing mobility (increase in bicycle use);
- reduction of accidents among vulnerable users (pedestrians, cyclists, children, and people over 65);
- reduction of mobility costs;
- promotion of cycling mobility;
- development of cycle tourism routes;
- improvement of the attractiveness, continuity, and recognizability of the cycling route.

Cycling routes are classified into different hierarchical levels:

- **Primary network**: links various parts of the city and towns to main attraction sites.
- **Secondary network**: cycling routes within neighborhoods or connecting cities to suburbs and attraction poles outside the main routes.
- **Green cycling routes**: connect green areas, parks, and rural areas of the municipal territory to the primary and secondary networks.

Cycling paths can be classified into various types based on the type of road network dedicated to each cycling route. 
In addition to providing a cycling network that connects different parts of the urban area, the Biciplan provides cyclists with dedicated signage, bicycle parking, cycling stations, bicycle rentals, bike-sharing, charging stations for e-bikes, information points, and bicycle repair shops.

Here for example the Biciplan for the city of Bologna: [https://pumsbologna.it/Biciplan_metropolitano](https://pumsbologna.it/Biciplan_metropolitano) and its in-depth documentation [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lciGZJFbxE7c86l0as0-OKFxV4879B2N] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lciGZJFbxE7c86l0as0-OKFxV4879B2N).

Specifically, in this document more technical suggestions were made for the application of the guidelines in Bologna: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lciGZJFbxE7c86l0as0-OKFxV4879B2N](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lciGZJFbxE7c86l0as0-OKFxV4879B2N). These guidelines seem to be related with our low level of traffic stress becuase they were planned for prompoting the safe use of bycicle infrastructures.

Here a few examples:

1) The **use of sidewalks for cycling** is beneficial both in urban areas, where they create cycling spaces when minimum dimensions for formally defined lanes are lacking, and especially in suburban areas, where they significantly improve cyclists' safety in the absence of separated systems. It's noteworthy that according to DM-2014, on-road lanes are not allowed where speed limits exceed 50 km/h. The legality of cyclists using sidewalks has been firmly established by precedent, which states that sidewalks, typically meant for pedestrians and emergency vehicle parking, can be used by vehicles for short-term maneuvers such as overtaking or facilitating vehicle intersection, or to avoid collisions. For the cyclists' safety, it would be advisable to 'invite' them to use existing and passable sidewalks, by placing pedestrian and bicycle symbols (fig.442/b), integrated with an arrow indicating the allowed direction for cyclists, at regular intervals (between 30 and 50 meters). 

2) **Coloring the pavement of bike lanes** is important to highlight their presence at side entries and crossings, and to make the cyclist's path more recognizable in complex areas. This is not horizontal signage, but rather a contrasting background that facilitates its reading; its use therefore does not conflict with what is provided by the CdS (art.137 c.6 RA) about the prohibition of using signals different from those explicitly provided.

3) **Mixed vehicular and bicycle routes.** DM-2014, which is quoted here verbatim (art.3.3.1), states that "..mixed routes, if it becomes necessary to identify them either to signal to cyclists the continuity of the route, or when the mixed route constitutes a short part of the itinerary between two stretches of cycle path, or to indicate to other motorized users the presence of a substantial flow of cyclists on the mixed route, can be identified by tracing a series of cycle path symbols (fig. II 442/b of the Regulation), near the right edge of the carriageway, or where the flow of cyclists must be directed. The symbols are traced longitudinally in the direction of the cyclist's travel and are repeated longitudinally at a minimum center-to-center distance of 30 m and a maximum of 50 m, depending on the increase in the speed of motor vehicles allowed on the road where the cycle route is inserted." The type of treatment described here, which is fully agreed upon, is appropriate and interesting even outside the creation of equipped itineraries or routes to improve the coexistence between motorized flows and cyclists, particularly at traffic light intersections where it is always appropriate to favor the formation of an informal approach corridor for cyclists, or in all cases where there is a need to highlight the presence of cyclists on the road.

Here the document regarding the Firenze's Biciplan which is very thorough with specific highlight on the goal of reducing the number of urban incidents for cyclists, regulatory frameworks and technical implementations of the document. [https://www.cittametropolitana.fi.it/wp-content/uploads/Appendice-2_Quadro-generale-Biciplan-metropolitano.pdf] (https://www.cittametropolitana.fi.it/wp-content/uploads/Appendice-2_Quadro-generale-Biciplan-metropolitano.pdf).

Some examples of implementations:

- Advanced bicycle stop line: to ensure, in the case of the presence of a bicycle lane, better visibility of cyclists by drivers of motor vehicles, when making right turn maneuver in the phase of green traffic lights, due to the conflict created with the flow bicycle that continues straight ahead.
- Advanced bicycle house: to facilitate the left turn maneuver for bicycles, which would otherwise be prevented in the event that the cyclist is positioned in the bike lane, i.e., on the
right side of the roadway.
- Bike lane in its own seat and/or reserved lane in the roadway
etc.


Here the document regarding Trento's Biciplan with focus on European and Italian legislation. In particular, a lot of attention was given to the different national DM which highlight some important information sucha as the minimum width of a lane (1.5 m). Also, the width of the physically impassable traffic island separating the bicycle lane in proper seat from the roadway intended for motor vehicles, shall not be less than
than 0.50 m etc. The other information are similar to the Florence case. Interestingly, a lot of attention was given to 30km/h limits on urban streets for their intrinsic property of being more safe and prevent mortal or severe incidents. Several critical issues have been identified such as: 

1) The existing cycle paths have been designed with a vision of mobility primarily focused on automobiles. Therefore, they have been constructed to minimize discomfort for motorized traffic. Consequently, the spaces intended for gentle mobility were often created in "possible" areas, not "necessary" ones.

2) Fragmentation of the cycle network that is not continuous, homogeneous, and safe.

3) Lack of connections between the city and the hill.

4) The presence of many shared cycle-pedestrian paths on sidewalks, which reduces attractiveness and forces cyclists to travel on roads, exposing them to greater risks.

5) Construction of cycle-pedestrian paths with dimensions smaller than those required by regulations, and with numerous obstacles for cyclists along the cycle section (furniture, trees, manholes, etc.).

6) Scarcity of Limited Traffic Zones (Z.T.L) and 30 km/h zones, and in some of the existing ones, there is only signage without the implementation of traffic calming measures.

7) Absence of a "plan" for the signage that could make the cycle network easily readable.

The analysis also involves the visualization of the areas interested with traffic incidents and questionairres regarding the mobility of the population.

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The section "Guidelines for the Design of Bicycle Paths in Trento" emphasizes the importance of addressing missing sections to establish a continuous, homogeneous, and safe cycling network. Existing routes, especially those along major traffic routes, need to be reviewed to minimize conflicts between pedestrians and cyclists. 
This can be achieved by utilizing new spaces taken from motorized traffic lanes or parking areas. 

The following intervention strategies are proposed:

1. In urban areas, it is preferable to create cycle paths or one-way cycle lanes on the right side of the road. This should be supported by implementing areas with a maximum speed limit of 30 km/h and traffic calming measures.

2. For existing shared pedestrian-cycling paths, they should be maintained for "slow" users (elderly and children). Where possible, separate cycle paths or one-way cycle lanes should be created on the right side of the road to accommodate faster cyclists (commuting or school routes).

3. If the width of the existing road does not allow for the construction of one-way cycle paths, the following intervention strategies should be considered to reclaim necessary space:
   a) Eliminating unnecessary road spaces (excessive vehicle lanes) and unused side strips.
   b) Removing a double lane where not necessary based on traffic flow.
   c) Reorganizing on-street parking spaces for vehicles.
   d) Removing parking areas.
   e) Reorganizing vehicular traffic and circulation by eliminating two-way lanes and implementing one-way streets.

4. For existing shared pedestrian-cycling paths, continuous maintenance, removal of obstacles, and clear signage should be ensured. Specific interventions should address issues such as narrow passages, blind curves, and intersections.

5. Construction of cycle paths within reserved lanes on sidewalks should only be considered to maintain continuity with existing paths of the same type. This is applicable when pedestrian flows are low, while complying with minimum width requirements specified by regulations.

6. New mixed-use cycling-pedestrian paths should be avoided in urban areas. If separate paths are not possible, it is preferable to focus on traffic calming measures and incorporate one-way cycle lanes on the road.

7. New cycle paths must comply with the minimum width requirements specified by regulations and should be free from obstacles (such as trees, street furniture, lighting and signage poles, etc.).

8. Bi-directional cycle paths in protected areas are preferred in rural areas.

9. In rural areas, shared cycling-pedestrian paths are acceptable, preferably with horizontal signage separating cycling and pedestrian lanes.

10. Unpainted pavement for the cycle path is recommended, with color only used at "caution" and conflict points (intersections, driveway crossings, etc.), to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Furthermore, thanks to traffic monitoring systems, these statements are supplemented by data on the demand for public and private mobility collected throughout the area. The collected data is presented cumulatively in the report.

Another important document for this topic is the recent guide proposed by the Centro Studi of FIAB (Federazione Italiana Ambiente e Bicicletta) about how to build efficient and safe bike lanes  [https://www.fiab.info/download/2020_12_CSFIAB_GuidaProgettareciclabilitasicura.pdf] (https://www.fiab.info/download/2020_12_CSFIAB_GuidaProgettareciclabilitasicura.pdf)
One of the first important aspects is the fact that the regulatory framework is immediately taken into consideration before formulating solutions. This is good because we can have a clear explanation of the current scenario from a regulatory ptw and provide an interpretation of the "Decreto Legge" (pag.9-12). Inside this document we can find important informations regarding what the characteristics a lane must have in terms of dimensions of the lane depending on the type of traffic or street involved (e.g 1.5 m large for standard bike lanes) or the road curbs (pag. 17). These can be useful for setting a ideal standard to compare our results. Interestingly, a focus is also given to extra-urban streets (pag 21-23)

The suggested criteria for designing lanes in these contexts are as follows:

In the case of a road with paved sidewalks of at least 50 cm and standard module lanes: a small-sized bicycle lane is inserted, ranging from 100 to 50 cm, depending on the width of the motor vehicle lane, which is either 375 cm or 325 cm. The criterion is to leave a space of 275 cm between the bicycle lane and the median.
In the case of a road without sidewalks or unpaved sidewalks: the bicycle lane can have a minimum width of 80 cm from the edge of the carriageway if it has flush edges, or 120 cm if it has vertical edges, while the space for motor vehicles should not be less than 220 cm. Thus, the road must have a minimum width of 600 cm.
In the case of a road with a width less than 600 cm: only ground markings are used, reinforcing other signage elements and speed control measures. Alternatively, for roads with very low traffic intended mainly for cycling, the previously described scheme can be used. By lowering speed limits, a single bidirectional central lane of 2.5/3 m width is designated, flanked by two lateral bicycle lanes delimited by dashed lines.

 <div style="text-align: justify;">
 Finally, I have taken into consideration the government guidelines for the creation of the Biciplan for a city.
 [https://www.mit.gov.it/sites/default/files/media/documentazione/2020-10/Linee%20guida.pdf](https://www.mit.gov.it/sites/default/files/media/documentazione/2020-10/Linee%20guida.pdf). As it can be seen, the Biciplan is a long-term project. Working with the perspective of PUMS (Urban Sustainable Mobility Plans) for our project also means developing both short-term and long-term solutions. Moreover, a specific focus should be made for the hierarchical structure of the bike network in a city. This can be useful in terms of defining different timelines at the local level in the case studies. As highlighted by the document, further analysis inside the Biciplan can cover the following aspects:
- Evolution of demand over the years.
- Potential mobility demand, related to the trips made by those who would use bicycles under certain conditions.
- Socio-demographic characteristics of individuals generating the demand (gender, age, occupation, etc.).
- Spatial distribution characteristics of the demand (origin, destination, places of major attraction).
- Temporal characteristics of the demand (timing and duration of trips, daily, weekly, seasonal, and annual frequency of trips).
- Motivation for the trips (study, work, family reasons, leisure, other, etc.).
- Mode of transportation used for individual trips (private, public, shared).
Moreover, further analysis (e.g. our LTS) is recommended somehow by a section of the document itself: *"2.1. Consistency of the cycling network.
By utilizing GIS tools, it is possible to reconstruct the graph of the municipal and/or metropolitan cycling network and associate specific technical and functional characteristics necessary for building a comprehensive understanding of the mobility offering with each route (or section of it, depending on the level of detail). This information can be linked to the type of cycle path, the type of served travel, the role of the route in the network, construction characteristics, etc. As a result, thematic maps can be produced to visualize the network based on its key features and identify any associated issues or challenges." *
Finally, working within the PUMS perspective is useful when conducting assessments of the local situation (in our case studies) because we can rely on the proposed framework for monitoring and evaluating the state of cycle paths (see pages 10-11), accessibility to key city nodes, and especially road safety (with a focus on accidents). Finally, various methods for calculating monitoring values in the analysis are defined (e.g., cyclist safety, safety improvement, etc.). A focus is given on using ISTAT data for micro-mobility but to my knowledge useful data are not present as mentioned (pag.26-27).
