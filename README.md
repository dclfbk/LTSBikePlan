# LTSBikePlan
Level of Traffic Stress Bike Planning and Infrastructure Network Design for Safe and Accessible Cycling

LTSBikePlan is an analisys tool aimed to identify safe and accessible cycling by developing a planning for bicycle infrastructure that takes into account the level of traffic stress from different data sources.

The starting infrastructural data are those of OpenStreetMap, to which are then added information data on the real use of the roads by cyclists, pedestrians and cars.
