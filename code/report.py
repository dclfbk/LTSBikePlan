<h2>{city_sanitized} - Level of Traffic Stress Bike Planning and Infrastructure Network Analysis for Safe and Accessible Cycling</h2>

</div>

## Introduction 

<div class='introduction-text'>

This report offers an in-depth analysis of a selected region's road network, focusing on the Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) and its relation to perceived risk. It integrates slope data from OpenStreetMap and uses DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and OPTICS algorithms for cluster analysis to identify areas of high stress. 
The study includes a classical network analysis, examining various centrality metrics and strongly connected components, using LTS values as weights, and evaluates intersection density for bikeability. 
Additionally, it assesses travel times to points of interest and identifies stress gaps using a modified IPDC procedure. 
The report also features a destination access analysis to calculate region's bike network analysis score, categorizing common destinations within an H3 hexagonal grid, and analyzes accidents in relation to BNA scores and connectivity. 
The goal is to shed light on the network's stress levels, bikeability, and safety.
